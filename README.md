## About

---

<<<<<<< HEAD
Dockwell is an easy to install and easy to spin up GUI that tracks, monitors, and displays all of a user's containers in Docker. With the ability to check logs and quickly compare container health, Dockwell works with Prometheus and Cadvisor to provide developers with an easy to use interface that will greatly assist in their debugging and development processes.
=======
Dockwell is an intuitive and comprehensive GUI that tracks, monitors, and displays all of a user's Docker containers.

We made Dockwell so that developers can quickly visualize container metrics to assist in their debugging and development process.

With the needs of developers in mind, Dockwell uses Prometheus and cAdvisor to scrape real-time metrics from the host machine, all from its own containerized environment.

Dockwell is an open source project and we would love to hear your feedback!

Live reloading of metric data displayed by individual container or all containers at once, in simple to read charts.

Environments section which displays all of a users active and inactive containers with the functionality to start, pause, and kill containers.

System metrics section which displays how much CPU and Memory Docker is currently using from the host machine, as well as by container.

# Logs section that allows a user to check and refresh the logs from each container's environment.

- Memory and CPU usage data are displayed graphically for each individual container.
- Memory and CPU usage data for _all containers_ are also displaed so that users can quickly compare metrics
<!-- Live reloading of metric data displayed by individual container or all containers at once, in simple to read charts. -->

- The right side of the interface displays all of a users active and inactive containers with the functionality to start, pause, unpause, and kill containers.

- The left side of the interfece displays a breakdown of memory and CPU usage.
  - A liguid guage shows the percent of each metric being used by all containers
  - A pie chart depicts the ratio metric usage by container
- All charts are dynamic and update every 1000ms
